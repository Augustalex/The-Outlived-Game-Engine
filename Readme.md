The Outlived game - made with Monogame

The players struggle to survive in a dark environment with a game experience that varies from easy to impossible in a linear fashion. With up to four players and four different playable characters to choose from, the abilities of each character plays a huge roll in the longevity of the game. But one shall not be mistaken, you will die. This game cannot be won.
The enemy of the game are viscous nightmare invoking… blobs. Not sure what they are, but they walk slow and throws a hard right punch! Maybe they’ve been drinking. And one should watch out for when someone has a gun, but it’s also a useful equipment resupply.

THIS IS......THE OUTLIVED
